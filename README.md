The work I am doing for the HarvardX course CS50 Introduction to Computer Science

Problem Set 0: Task is to create something/anything in Scratch. I created a game where you control a dragon and kill dinosaurs that appear. Due to time restrictions, there is actually no way to die and there is no end to the game.
